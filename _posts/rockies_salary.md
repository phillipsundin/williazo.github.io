As the 2019 Colorado Rockies season comes to a disappointing conclusion. I thought it would be a good time to look back at some of the recent history with respect to contracts and salary spending. Much of the frustration from this 2019 season stems from issues the front office had in identifying quality free agents to help push promising Rockies teams over the edge into serious postseason success.

The front office, led by General Manager Jeff Bridich, have gone out to purchase relief pieces, most notably Wade Davis, Bryan Shaw, and Jake McGee, and veteran bats, see Ian Desmond and Daniel Murphy. However, all of these players have varied from failure to disastrous dumpster fire in terms of success on the field.
