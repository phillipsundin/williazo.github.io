Hello! Thank you for visiting my website. As I began to explore the structure available, and learned more about how to actually format my material using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), I have toyed with the idea of starting a blog aspect as part of this content. This would be a collection of posts for my thoughts on stats, sports, life experiences, traveling, cooking, and who knows what else.

As any great idea starts there is much promise at the beginning and yet much unknown about execution. In this first month or so I will try to post weekly and then we will see where it goes from there. So buckle in for the journey and let's see where this journey takes me.
