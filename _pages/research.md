- co-authored with HÃ©ctor Corrada Bravo, Jennifer Tom, and Joseph Paulson while working at Genentech, Inc.
- simulate longitudinal differential abundance for microbiome data
- under review for inclusion in [BioConductor](https://bioconductor.org)

[tcensReg](https://github.com/williazo/tcensReg)
- calculate maximum likelihood estimates from truncated normal distribution with censored observations

[ggplot.spaghetti](https://github.com/williazo/ggplot.spaghetti)
- visualize longitudinal time trends
- investigate group differences

[rwindow.baseball](https://github.com/williazo/rwindow.baseball)
- scrape data from multiple baseball outlets including FanGraphs, baseball-reference, etc.
